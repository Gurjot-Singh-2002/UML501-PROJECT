**Working:** Following steps show how the Model will predict the Stock Prices-
1.	Loading the Training Dataset
2.	Data Preprocessing
3.	Splitting Dataset into X-train and Y-train
4.	Building RNN Model using LSTM
5.	Preparing input for model
6.	Predicting the Stock price
7.	Plotting the Actual and Predicted Stock prices
